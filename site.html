        <h3>Started September, 2023.</h3>
        <p>
          This website was one of the first. I had an idea to create a website,
          that details what I am learning, WHILE adding the things I have
          learned into it.
          <br />
          ... an everlasting project!

        This was the tutorial I used as a boilerplate. Obviously the landing
        page did not have a video. I chose not to put a video, because I don't
        want to force it too hard. If I find a great suitcase to implement a
        video, I will do it. Maybe for the future, I could have a background
        video of users coding.
        <br />

        TraversyMedia creates some amazing tutorials that I have been following
        as of late. He helped me come up with the idea for this site.

        I am limited to only HTML, CSS, and JS right now. My plan is to work on
        these, even without Boostrap, React, etc. so that I can get as
        comfortable as I can. I would love to add the above to future projects,
        or ones that need improvement.
